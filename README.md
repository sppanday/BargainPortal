Guideline
(1) Please branch off develop, not master, and when you merge your branch merge back to develop, do not merge or try to branch off master, master is our final final branch that will have very refined code
(2) Work on your own branch, understand github, git etc if you are unfamiliar , work on it, and push to your branch
(3)  Send merge request or merge in your local, and push to github
(4) Don't commit too many unncessary bits, or dont commit something you think is not into the norms of writing this application.
(5) Don't commit code that doesn't compile, and don't commit something outside our framework which is pretty obvious.
